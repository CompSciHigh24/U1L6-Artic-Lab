// Task 1
// Define a function called getDogArtworks that makes the API call to the request URL you defined in the worksheet (to get 3 dog artworks)
// Make sure to console log all 3 titles (after you get the data retrieve the nested values) 



// Call the function and confirm it worked correctly


// Task 2
// Define another function called searchArtworks that takes in a search query and a size limit
// You can use the function above and modify it to make the API call with the function parameters instead
// You will need to use string concatenation to build the request URL
// Now when the function it's called it should only return artwork the specified # of artworks based on the inputed search query
// Make sure to console log the values. 




// Call the new function with the user inputs and confirm it worked correctly 
// Test with anything you'd like like 5 "cats" or 2 "flowers"
